   ### - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
From the election results, we can count that Jefferson had a voter turnout of 38,855; Denver had 306,055; and Arapahoe had 24,801. This was tracked by the amount of times the county name appeared on the election results csv provided. Taking the number of votes cast in each county and dividing it by the total voters and then multiplying the number by 100, we can see the percentage turnout for each county. From the image below, we can see Denver had the highest percentage of voter turnout at 82.8%, followed by Jefferson at 10.5% and then Arapahoe had only 6.7% of the voter turnout of the three counties.

   ### - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
There were 369,711 votes cast in this data set and three candidates were in the election: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. The votes each candidate received respecfully were 85,213; 271,892; and 11,606. This was tracked the same way the counties were tracked, using a counter to tally everytime the candiates name appeared in the candidate column. Similarly, the percentage of votes for each candiate could be calculated just like the county percentage; Taking the number of votes cast for each candidate and dividing it by the total voters and then multiplying the number by 100. From this formula, we can see the percentage turnout for each candidate. From the image below, we can see Diana DeGette had the highest percentage of votes at 73.8%, followed by Charles Casper Stockham at 23.0% and then Raymon Anthony Doane had only 3.1% of the votes.
